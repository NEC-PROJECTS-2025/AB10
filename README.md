## Introduction  
Hand gesture recognition is essential for human-computer interaction, enabling touchless control in various applications. This project utilizes deep learning models, including CNNs and RNNs, to enhance recognition accuracy and real-time performance. Advanced preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are applied to improve robustness across different environments.  

## Features  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Uses CNN, LSTM, GRU, and hybrid models like Inception-GRU for improved accuracy.  
- **Preprocessing Techniques:** Includes frame extraction, noise reduction, and normalization for better data quality.  
- **Real-Time Recognition:** Optimized for real-world applications such as AR/VR, assistive technology, and smart home control.  
- **Dataset Augmentation:** Implements data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.  

## Dataset  
This project uses a publicly available hand gesture recognition dataset consisting of RGB video sequences labeled for different gestures.
